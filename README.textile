h2. Hudson Mirah wrapper

Java classes and wrappers to allow to write Hudson plugins with Mirah.

Right now Mirah, version 0.4, doesn't support generics but Hudson uses all
around its plugins and they are a key for the discovery system.

This project aims to contain java wrappers with those required generics so
Mirah classes can extend from them and avoid generics.
